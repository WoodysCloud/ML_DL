      "features[-2]## There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.\n",
      "##My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history. \n",
      "sound[+2]##SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.\n",
      "## The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.\n",
      "equalizer[-1]## It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. \n",
      "bass[+3],treble[+2]##The bass is deep and the treble is clear.\n",
      "battery[-2]##  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.\n",
      "##This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore. \n",
      "##iRiver's battery lasts four to five years. \n",
      "Replaceable battery[-3]##Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.\n",
      "## However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support. \n",
      "##The iPod's battery, 1.5 years. \n",
      "##Yeah, pretty weak.\n",
      "flip side[-2]## Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.\n",
      "## While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.\n",
      "case[-2]## Also, not liking the gel case. \n",
      "##iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.\n",
      "features[-3]## FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. \n",
      "FM tuner[-3]##There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. \n",
      "voice recording[-3]## There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.\n",
      "photo viewing[-1]## There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.\n",
      "## There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.\n",
      "use[+3]##  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.\n",
      "##The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad). \n",
      "iTunes[-1]##I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. \n",
      "##I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.\n",
      "## Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer. \n",
      "##Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.\n",
      "## BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer. \n",
      "CUSTOMER SERVICE[-3]## CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. \n",
      "##If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty. \n",
      "##They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.\n",
      "technical service[-3]## There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.\n",
      "##At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.  \n",
      "iPod[-3], sound quality[+2], design[+2]##OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. \n",
      "##Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead. \n",
      "##God Save Apple\t I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac. \n",
      "##Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple. \n",

      "Apple[+2]##Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     \n",
      "ipod[+2]##I have an ipod and it is a great buy. \n",
      "##It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.\n",
      "sturdy[+2]## Very sturdy and strong.\n",
      "games[-1]## Doesn't have alot of good games on it.\n",
      "## the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs. \n",
      "##buy it.      \n",
      "iPod[+3],service[-2]##iPod is brilliant, but service was awful\n",
      "## Wow iPod. \n",
      "##How did we listen to music before it?\n",
      "##This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc. \n",
      "iTunes[+2]##The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. \n",
      "##iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download. \n",
      "click wheel[+2]##This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  \n",
      "##It allows fast and easy navigation.\n",
      "## The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. \n",
      "song quality[+3],ear buds[+3]## The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.\n",
      "scratches[-1]## The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. \n",
      "##It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.\n",
      "Battery life[+1]## Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. \n",
      "##I use my iPod all the time. \n",
      "## You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc. \n",
      "##The problem with my iPod. \n",
      "## The first one I received skipped songs randomly. \n",
      "## I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.\n",
      "## I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.  \n",
      "##However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. \n",
      "Apple[+2]##Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. \n",
      "product[+2]## The product I rate five stars, \n",
      "service[-2]##but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.\n",
      "## However, you should still buy an iPod!\n",
      "## The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.\n",
      "Amazon[+2]##  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  \n",
      "##I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it. \n",
      "##iPod will change the way you enjoy music!      \n",
      "##Very Pleased.\n",
      "##I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.\n",
      "interface[-1]## The interface took a little getting used to.\n",
      "## The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it. \n",
      "display[+2]## This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. \n",
      "photos[+2]##I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. \n",
      "sound[+1]## The sound is just fine. \n",
      "##I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.\n",
      "## I use it to listen to language tapes and to play \"Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.  \n",
      "adapter[+1]##It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  \n",
      "##I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end. \n",
      "##Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss. \n",
      "photo quality[-1]## One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.\n",
      "## I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.     \n",
      "##Here's the TRUTH in short....\t \n",
      "##This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons. \n",
      "Hard Drive[+2], affordable[+2]## Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. \n",
      "Screen[+2]##Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2\" \n",
      "Battery[+1]##Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  \n",
      "##12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.\n",
      "FireWire[+3],USB[+3]## FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.\n",
      "Design[+3]## Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. \n",
      "sound[+2],Durable[+2],compact[+1]##Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy \n",
      "Games[+1]##Games-- not really important, but existant \n",
      "Hold[+1]##Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. \n",
      "Radio Tuner[-2]## Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing\n",
      "Voice Recorder[-2]##3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.\n",
      "Memory Stick slots[-2],Battery[-2]## No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient\n",
      "iTunes[+1]##. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. \n",
      "accessories[-1]##No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.\n",
      "Overall[+1]##  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.\n",
      "##  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player. \n",
      "## This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.     \n",
      "##Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead\t If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look. \n",
      "##I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.\n",
      "## A sound decision and a happy customer right here!\n",
      "## I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400. \n",
      "##The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!   \n",
      "##It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer. \n",
      "##No need to install the iTunes. \n",
      "Versatile[+2]##Versatile and stylish.\t \n",
      "design[+2],capacity[+2],connection options[+2],iTunes[+2]##I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   \n",
      "battery[-1]##The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   \n",
      "controls[+2]##The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  \n",
      "##And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive. \n",
      "iPod[+2]## The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      \n",
      "##Still not so sure about this one...\t\n",
      "iPod[-1]## First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. \n",
      "## So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.\n",
      "##  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.  \n",
      "battery[-2]##In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.\n",
      "##  Again, another hassle. \n",
      "## To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.  \n",
      "##But enought of the negativity. \n",
      "quality[+2]## I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.\n",
      "## Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).  \n",
      "interface[+2], use[+3]##Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  \n",
      "##Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so. \n",
      "## I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine. \n",
      "iTunes[+1]## As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. \n",
      "## I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.\n",
      "##  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.\n",
      "iPod[+2]## In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.\n",
      "##  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money. \n",
      "##Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.      \n",
      "## i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. \n",
      "##when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! \n",
      "##simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!\n",
      "## the packing inside was in tatters. \n",
      "##i didnt touch the product. \n",
      "## i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.\n",
      "## they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. \n",
      "##then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.\n",
      "## a week passed but it was never picked up.\n",
      "## the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company. \n",
      "##buyers BEWARE!     \n",
      "##There's got to be a better solution...\t  \n",
      "##I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.\n",
      "sensitive[-2]## *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. \n",
      "## You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.  \n",
      "##*\tThe 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *\t\n",
      "Battery[-1]##The Battery does not last 12 hours.  \n",
      "##Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.\n",
      "##  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it. \n",

      "apple[-2]##If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for \"abusing\" your ipod.\n",

      "##Buyer beware!      \n",
      "iPod[+2]##Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.\n",
      "design[+2],capacity[+2],iTunes[+2]## Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. \n",
      "capacity[+2]## Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  \n",

      "##Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod \"hard drive\" to a new letter.\n",
      "## If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software! \n",
      "## This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use. \n",
      "##In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!  \n",
