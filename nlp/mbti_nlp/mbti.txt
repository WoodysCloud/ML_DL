Introduction 01
WHO IS AN ENTREPRENEUR (ESTP)?

An Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting
personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of
them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
HELEN KELLER
Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings –
the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of
people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and
entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love
to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on
stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.
Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and
their implications don’t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long.
Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of
intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out
and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they
go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.

Diving Right In
Entrepreneurs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky
behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the
eye of the storm. People with the Entrepreneur personality type enjoy
drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so
stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions
based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational
stimulus response.
This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for
Entrepreneurs. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do
well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so
far from the hands-on learning that Entrepreneurs enjoy. It takes a great
deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end,
something that creates more exciting opportunities.
12/14/21, 5:11 PM Introduction | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities

Also challenging is that to Entrepreneurs, it makes more sense to use their
own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken.
This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are
likely to share, and can earn Entrepreneur personalities a certain
reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy,
and focus through the boring stuff, Entrepreneurs are a force to be
reckoned with.
The Path Less Traveled
With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type,
Entrepreneurs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift
in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this
personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types
would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. Entrepreneurs use these
observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions,
often with little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that
not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast.
Sometimes Entrepreneurs’ instantaneous observation and action is
just what’s required, as in some corporate environments, and
especially in emergencies.
12/14/21, 5:11 PM Introduction | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-personality 5/6
If Entrepreneurs aren’t careful though, they may get too caught in the
moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive
people, or forget to take care of their own health and safety. Making up only
four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out
there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a
systemic risk.
Entrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational,
if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are
natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled,
bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a
constructive and rewarding end is Entrepreneurs’ true challenge.

12/14/21, 5:25 PM Strengths & Weaknesses | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-strengths-and-weaknesses 2/5
Bold – People with the Entrepreneur personality type are full of life and
energy. There is no greater joy for Entrepreneurs than pushing
boundaries and discovering and using new things and ideas.
Rational and Practical – Entrepreneurs love knowledge and philosophy,
but not for their own sake. What’s fun for Entrepreneur personalities is
finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can
put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better
uses for Entrepreneurs’ time.
Original – Combining their boldness and practicality, Entrepreneurs love
to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in
ways no one else would think to.
Perceptive – This originality is helped by Entrepreneurs’ ability to notice
when things change – and when they need to change! Small shifts in
habits and appearances stick out to Entrepreneurs, and they use these
observations to help create connections with others.
12/14/21, 5:25 PM Strengths & Weaknesses | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-strengths-and-weaknesses 3/5
Direct – This perceptive skill isn’t used for mind games – Entrepreneurs
prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and
answers. Things are what they are.
Sociable – All these qualities pull together to make a natural group leader
in Entrepreneurs. This isn’t something that they actively seek – people
with this personality type just have a knack for making excellent use of
social interactions and networking opportunities.
Entrepreneur Weaknesses
Insensitive – Feelings and emotions come second to facts and “reality”
for Entrepreneurs. Emotionally charged situations are awkward,
uncomfortable affairs, and Entrepreneurs’ blunt honesty doesn’t help
here. These personalities often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and
expressing their own feelings as well.
12/14/21, 5:25 PM Strengths & Weaknesses | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-strengths-and-weaknesses 4/5
Impatient – Entrepreneurs move at their own pace to keep themselves
excited. Slowing down because someone else “doesn’t get it” or having to
stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for
Entrepreneurs.
Risk-prone – This impatience can lead Entrepreneurs to push into
uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences.
Entrepreneur personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom
with extra risk.
Unstructured – Entrepreneurs see an opportunity – to fix a problem, to
advance, to have fun – and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and
social expectations in the process. This may get things done, but it can
create unexpected social fallout.
May Miss the Bigger Picture – Living in the moment can cause
Entrepreneurs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this
personality type love to solve problems here and now, perhaps too much.
All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those
parts do not fit together.
Defiant – Entrepreneurs won’t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules,
sitting quietly while they are lectured at – this isn’t how Entrepreneurs live
their lives. They are action-oriented and hands-on. Environments like
school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they’re

intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from Entrepreneurs to stay
focused long enough to get to freer positions.

https://www.16personalities.com/estp-relationships-dating 2/4
When it comes to romantic relationships, people with the Entrepreneur
personality type can hardly be said to be pining away for their wedding day.
Life is fun and full of surprises (something Entrepreneurs have particular
skill in delivering), and they enjoy it all in the here and now. Entrepreneurs
may not spend a lot of time planning for “someday”, but their enthusiasm
and unpredictability make them thrilling dating partners.
Entrepreneurs’ relationships are far from boring. Their
improvisational style creates a seemingly never-ending list of
activities and hobbies to be involved in, and Entrepreneurs fully
encourage their partners to partake.
Entrepreneurs love new ideas and the occasional philosophical discussion –
but they need to be topics that can explored through action together, not
just idle talk. There’s musing about the causes and effects of epidemic
obesity, and there’s training for a marathon together to promote healthy
living.

The Challenge of Intimacy
Sexually, Entrepreneurs have no real reservations. It’s fun, it’s physically
enjoyable, new ideas are always welcome, and Entrepreneur personalities’
strong perception keeps them well-tuned to their partners’ needs. However,
Entrepreneurs’ separation of the physical act from the more emotional and
spiritual connections that many other types look for in intimacy can be a
serious source of tension if everybody isn’t on the same page. Some types
need sex to be a genuine expression of love – Entrepreneurs just aren’t one
of them.
As time passes, it can be challenging for Entrepreneurs to move their
relationships to deeper, more emotionally intimate levels. Easily bored,
people with the Entrepreneur personality type seek constant excitement –
sometimes even intentionally exposing themselves to risk if they feel stuck.
If their partners aren’t able to keep up, Entrepreneurs may just end up
looking for someone new. It’s not that Entrepreneur personalities are

unfaithful. Rather, they may think to themselves “This isn’t working, so why
should I pretend it is?” Entrepreneurs are rational, and can exercise selfcontrol if they choose, but being as charming and popular as they are, it can
sometimes be a little too easy to move on.
Loving Without Inhibition
As with any relationship, it takes work and patience. Not every day can be a
thrill a minute. But Entrepreneurs are adaptable, curious individuals, which
certainly helps to keep the flame burning. Maintaining healthy relationships
is the ultimate chance for Entrepreneurs to exercise their talents in
perceiving every change in their partners’ mood and behavior, while also
using their problem-solving abilities to address their needs. Entrepreneurs
can also strengthen more neglected traits, like emotional sensitivity and
long-term planning.

https://www.16personalities.com/estp-friends 2/4
People with the Entrepreneur personality type are definitely the life of the
party. With an enviable imagination and invigorating sense of spontaneity,
Entrepreneurs are never boring. They love exploring interesting ideas, both
in discussion and by going out and seeing for themselves, which means that
Entrepreneurs always seem to have some fun activity hidden up their
sleeves. At the same time, Entrepreneur personalities are easy-going,
tolerant, and charming, making them naturally quite popular.
A Zest for Life
Hands-on, physical activities like team sports are Entrepreneurs’ idea of fun,
and these environments give them plenty of chances to make new friends.
There is little difficulty for Entrepreneurs here – they seem to get along with
just about everyone, and make new friends wherever they go.
Entrepreneurs live in the moment, and as a naturally confident personality
type (especially if they are Assertive as well), they don’t worry much about
what others think of them. This attracts friends who share their attitude and
zest for life.
12/14/21, 5:26 PM Friendships | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-friends 3/4
While not opposed to long philosophical discussions, and often enjoying the
intellectual exercise, Entrepreneurs are unlikely to develop friendships
based solely around one-on-one discussions about European economic
challenges and the role of religion in politics. Straightforward to the point of
being blunt, Entrepreneurs call it like they see it, and an honest opinion in
debate is a sure thing. But at their hearts, Entrepreneurs are people of
action, preferring to do what can be done than to talk about what might
someday be.
Adventure Awaits
Sitting idle, especially in boredom, is the bane of Entrepreneurs’
existence.

Exploration, excitement, adrenaline and risk – Entrepreneurs’ friends should
be prepared for all of these things. Often enough they’re happy to perform
for the crowd, but they also tend to encourage their friends to join in. Most
personality types might take “thanks but no thanks” personally, but
Entrepreneurs are comfortable with who they are, and are more likely to
just shrug their shoulders and move on with those friends who are game for
adventure.

12/14/21, 5:27 PM Parenthood | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-parents 2/4
In a lot of ways, Entrepreneurs are what many children would consider the
perfect parent. Fun-loving and playful, flexible and understanding, people
with the Entrepreneur personality type genuinely enjoy spending time with
their children, and know how to make sure everyone is having a good time.
Entrepreneurs have a natural curiosity and spontaneity that is perfectly
matched to the wonder and insatiable desire to learn that young children
have.
Freedom to Explore
Entrepreneurs love hands-on activities, and their children aren’t left wanting
for someone to play catch with, or to help them build a model for school.
Sports, hiking, and other practical, hands-on hobbies are all welcomed and
encouraged. At the same time, given their aversion to rules and schedules
themselves, Entrepreneurs aren’t likely to forcibly enter their children into
all manner of clubs and teams. If their kids want to play softball, great – if
not, well, they’ll just find something else to do.
12/14/21, 5:27 PM Parenthood | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-parents 3/4
Maybe the greatest thing about Entrepreneur parents is that they
see their children as equal members of the family.
Entrepreneurs give their children freedom, encourage them to use their
own judgment (especially with the minor stuff), and to follow their hearts –
to heck with what other people think. Entrepreneur personalities keep a
close enough eye on their kids, using that knack for picking up on even the
slightest changes in others’ moods and habits, that they can step in with
extra guidance when things start to go wrong.
Entrepreneurs do have one significant parental challenge though: emotional
bonding. Feelings tend to be seen by Entrepreneurs as a bit of an irrational
distraction, rather than a tool for expression and connection. If their
children happen to be more sensitive, this can be a source of tension
between Entrepreneurs and their children. Frank honesty isn’t always the
best prescription.
Focusing on Connection
Still, Entrepreneurs often find that parenthood gives them all the motivation
they need to work on their sensitivity and emotional attunement. Through
shared activities and experiences, these parents can create healthy, genuine
bonds with their children, gaining a deeper knowledge of their children’s

unique needs and dreams and way of being in the world. Entrepreneurs
have the added benefit of direct and understanding relationships – their
children won’t feel so much like they have to hide their mistakes and
challenges, the holy grail of parent-child communication.

12/14/21, 5:27 PM Career Paths | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-careers 2/4
When it comes to Entrepreneurs’ career options, “action” is the word of the
day. People with the Entrepreneur personality type think on their feet and
are great at making quick decisions in the heat of the moment. At the same
time, they’re affable people who always seem to make friends and
connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge
assets in the working world, and Entrepreneurs nail it.
This social intelligence, combined with Entrepreneurs’ natural boldness and
improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, even
acting – any tense, competitive environment – a great fit. Entrepreneur
personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small,
are a part of life, and Entrepreneurs don’t sit around waiting for some boss
at the top to tell them what to do. This can get Entrepreneurs into trouble,
but often enough it’s exactly what’s needed, and can boost them up the
career ladder just as well.
12/14/21, 5:27 PM Career Paths | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estp-careers 3/4
It’s hard to imagine Entrepreneurs choosing secure but boring jobs
over less stable but more exciting careers.
Restrictions, rules, highly structured environments – these are great ways to
drive Entrepreneurs crazy. People with this personality type live life on their
own terms, and this makes them brilliant business people and freelancers.
These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work,
the accounting, meticulous research and so forth, to those better suited.
Entrepreneurs are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There
are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource
distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the
streets, and save lives with their own two hands – Entrepreneur
personalities are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient,
enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance, and act. Any
emergency response role is great for Entrepreneurs, whether it be as
paramedics, police officers, or soldiers.
The Thrill of the Game
This quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their
efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of
pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for

the win can have no comparison for Entrepreneurs. Whether they are on
the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines or
commentating from high above, people with the Entrepreneur personality
type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of
these positions makes a fine line of work for them.

https://www.16personalities.com/estps-at-work 2/4
In just about any environment, the workplace included, it’s pretty easy to
spot Entrepreneurs. Boisterous and spontaneous, fun-loving and maybe a
little crass, people with the Entrepreneur personality type love tackling
problems as they arise and telling great stories about their solutions
afterwards. Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than
others, but Entrepreneurs are adaptable individuals, and can find a way to
make just about any situation a little more interesting.
Entrepreneur Subordinates
Entrepreneurs’ most challenging position is the one that most people have
to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising
restraint on their own terms, Entrepreneur personalities hate having others’
rules and regulations foisted upon them. Entrepreneurs are known for their
experimentation, improvisation and quick thinking – if they’re not allowed to
use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little
thing, they’ll be bored and frustrated.
12/14/21, 5:27 PM Workplace Habits | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities
https://www.16personalities.com/estps-at-work 3/4
Entrepreneurs know well that risk equals reward, and they’ll gladly skirt
more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting, in the
hope that it catches someone’s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long
way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of
staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn’t Entrepreneurs’ way
– they move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis.
Entrepreneur Colleagues
As colleagues, Entrepreneurs have a work hard, play hard mentality – as
long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they’ll gladly pull their own, and
have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are,
networking comes naturally to Entrepreneurs. These qualities make it easy
for Entrepreneur personalities to get along with just about anyone.
At the same time, if Entrepreneurs see a colleague as incompetent, or
worse, lazy, they let them know in no uncertain terms. Emotional sensitivity
is not their strong suit. Entrepreneurs are very observant and well-tuned to
changes in their colleagues’ habits and moods – unless they themselves are
the cause of distress.
Entrepreneur Managers
Management positions are where Entrepreneurs are usually most
comfortable, as they often give the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are

a bother for people with the Entrepreneur personality type – they’d rather
try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or
better than to pay attention to “the way things have always been done” or
subordinates’ comfort with experimentation. Entrepreneurs are practical,
with a focus on what does, or could, work best.
This can make for a chaotic environment, but Entrepreneurs’ inspiring cult
of personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing.
Entrepreneurs enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad,
intangible future accomplishment like “making customers happy”,
Entrepreneur personalities set small, clear, measurable, and attainable
goals that keep things on track day-to-day, and hearty congratulations can
always be relied on for a job well done. Entrepreneurs keep their eyes on
the finish line, but they get there step by step.

Few personality types are as charming and attractive as Entrepreneurs.
Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present,
Entrepreneurs are great at finding exciting new things to explore and
experience. Entrepreneurs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are
invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.
Yet Entrepreneurs can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus
on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding
(or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or
learning to plan ahead, Entrepreneurs need to put in a conscious effort to
develop their weaker traits and additional skills.
What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complex concept
that is the Entrepreneur personality type. You may have muttered to
yourself, “wow, this is so accurate it’s a little creepy” or “finally, someone
understands me!” You may have even asked “how do they know more about
me than the people I’m closest to?”
